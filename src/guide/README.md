VuePress is composed of two parts: a [minimalistic static site generator](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/tree/master/packages/%40vuepress/core) with a Vue-powered [theming system](../theme/README.md) and [Plugin API](../plugin/README.md), and a [default theme](../theme/default-theme-config.md) optimized for writing technical documentation. It was created to support the documentation needs of Vueâ€™s own sub projects.
